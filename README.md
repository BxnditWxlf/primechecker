Very basic program that checks if a number is a prime

Extract zip file or clone url


cd into new directory


run "sudo chmod +x compile.sh" to make the file executible


then run it with "compile.sh"

you may have to give the compiled program executible permissions as well


Run "sudo chmod +x primechecker"

then run the script with "./primechecker"


If you want to permenantly add this command to your system, you can add it to your /usr/local/bin folder or equivelent for your operating system using sudo mv /usr/local/bin (or your equivelent directory)
